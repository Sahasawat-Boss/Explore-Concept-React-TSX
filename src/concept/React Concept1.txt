In React
- index.html script tag import here
 index.html (Public Entry Point)
    - The index.html file is located in the public folder (or directly in the project root, depending on the setup). It is the base HTML file where React mounts the app.

    - It has an empty <div id="root"></div> that acts as the container for the React app.

    - A <script> tag loads the main.tsx (or main.js) file, which starts the React app.

    <body>
        <div id="root"></div>  <!-- React App will be rendered here -->
        <script type="module" src="/src/main.tsx"></script>
    </body>


    - The <div id="root"></div> acts as the mounting point for the React app.
    - The script loads src/main.tsx, which injects the React app into the root div.

--------------------------------------------------------
- src
- src/main.tsx
main.tsx (Entry Point of React)
    - The main.tsx file is responsible for injecting React components into index.html.

    >> React Code put in to index.html
    >> Get Root element and Render an application

    createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
        <StrictMode>
            <App />
        </StrictMode>,
    )

    Key Points
   -  Imports React – Needed to use React components.
    - Imports createRoot – This is used to render React in index.html.
    - Gets the Root Element – document.getElementById("root")!
    - Renders the App – The <App /> component is placed inside StrictMode for better debugging.


Component
- src/App.tsx
App.tsx (Main Component)
    - The App.tsx is a React component, written as a function. It is the main component of the application.


    >> function and export
    >> Capital letter is a function

    Key Points
    - A React component must start with a capital letter (App).
    - This function returns JSX (<h1>...</h1>).
    - The export default App; statement makes this component available for import in main.tsx.

--------------------------------------------------------
Component
- only return one element
- Wrap everything for tag or fragment <> (empty tag)

{} << this will run as javascript code
